# EastAfrica_Virome
This repository consists of two parts: 

1. Code and important intermediate files;
2. Virus vANI95 representative genome. 

The code provided in this repository is mostly intended for review and reference purposes, rather than for execution. Due to limitations in the runtime environment and the completeness of related intermediate files, we make no guarantees about the executability of this code, and strongly recommend not to do any attempts to run it.
